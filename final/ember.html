        <p class="explain">When I’m here at school, I like parameters. I don’t like having to think of things to build or create on my own at school because school, for me at least, ruins being creative and free-form thinking, you can thank the photo department here for that. So coming up with something sucked, and when I figured out what I could do I dove in. I watched nine hours worth of tutorials on Ember. I read through scores of sites and thousands of line of code. Let’s start with the <a href="img/install.pdf">install</a>.</p>
        <p class="explain">After a frantic email to a professor, who gave me an awesome tutorial to follow, I seemed to get the hang of it. I've simplified the basic creation of a new Ember <a href="img/homepage.pdf">app</a>.</p>
        <p class="explain">Normally, I can do navigation bars pretty well. The <a href="img/links.pdf">link-to's</a> gave me trouble. Especially while I was trying to do a form on one of the other pages.</p>
        <p class="explain">So I connected my server, and was going to just work on one route at a time. Divide and conquer right? NOPE. I was severely mistaken. I was trying to work on the login form, and I got the controller to work, but every time I loaded the javascript in, I received a build error. Three days. Three days of my life I spent going through EVERY folder connected to Ember. For three days I thought I was a complete idiot. I was freaking out. So, I sent my file to Emily and Emily had the same problem. Relieved and now thoroughly pissed off to an unimaginable extent, I calmly shut Ember down. I have no intention of giving up on this, it's how I was raised. I just need more time to figure out what is disconnected between all my folders.</p>
